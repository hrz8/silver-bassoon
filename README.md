## Setup

After cloning the repo, you need to install Go dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Initialize the Database

The provided `.csv` files are located in the `cmd/gen/files` directory. Additionally, all generated `.sql` files can be found in the `cmd/migrate/migrations` directory.

```bash
├── cmd
│   ├── gen
│   │   ├── files
│   │   │   ├── customer_companies.csv
│   │   │   ├── customers.csv
│   │   │   ├── deliveries.csv
│   │   │   ├── order_items.csv
│   │   │   └── orders.csv
│   │   └── main.go
│   └── migrate
│       ├── main.go
│       └── migrations
│           └── 00_initial.up.sql
```

### Generate `.sql` from `.csv`

To generate the migration (`.sql` file), run:

```bash
go run cmd/gen/main.go
```

At this stage, you will be prompted with the message: `migration file already exists`. This is expected since, by default, the program checks for the existence of the default migration file first.

To create a new migration file from the provided `.csv` files, use:

```bash
go run cmd/gen/main.go -new
```

If you inspect the result of the generated `.sql` file, you'll notice that all columns are using `VARCHAR(255)` as the data type. This is intentional for simplicity. However, if you prefer to generate **well-defined** and **appropriate** data types, you can do so using OpenAI tools in the next step.

### Generate Well-defined `.sql`

To enable this feature, first, you need to have an `OPEN AI KEY`. You can generate your own `KEY` from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Once you have the `KEY`, run this command:

```bash
OPEN_AI_KEY=your-key go run cmd/gen/main.go -new
```

Note: This process may take a longer time as it will generate the provided seed data that will be inserted.
