# silver-bassoon

## Setup

After cloning the repo, you need to install Go dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Initialize the Database (Short Mode)

To initiate the Database from `.csv` using script (Golang), run this:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname ./initdb.sh
```

## Initialize the Database (Advance Mode - Recommended)

_NOTE: If you've done the short mode, you need to cleanup your db first, and then run this:_

```bash
./cleandb.sh
```

### Start!

The provided `.csv` files are located in the `cmd/gen/files` directory. Additionally, all generated `.sql` files can be found in the `cmd/migrate/migrations` directory.

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gen
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ files
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ customer_companies.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ customers.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deliveries.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ order_items.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ orders.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ migrate
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ migrations
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ 00_initial.up.sql
```

### Generate `.sql` from `.csv`

To generate the migration (`.sql` file), run:

```bash
go run cmd/gen/main.go
```

At this stage, you will be prompted with the message: `migration file already exists`. This is expected since, by default, the program checks for the existence of the default migration file first.

To create a new migration file from the provided `.csv` files, use:

```bash
go run cmd/gen/main.go -new
```

Once the process done, you will got new file under `cmd/migrate/migrations` directory.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gen
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ migrate
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ migrations
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ 00_initial.up.sql
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ 2024012XXXXXXX_initial.up.sql (NEW)
```

If you inspect the result of the generated `.sql` file, you'll notice that all columns are using `VARCHAR(255)` as the data type. This is intentional for simplicity. However, if you prefer to generate **well-defined** and **appropriate** data types, you can do so using OpenAI tools in the next step.

### Generate Well-Defined `.sql`

To enable this feature, first, you need to have an `OPEN AI KEY`. You can generate your own `KEY` from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Once you have the `KEY`, run this command:

```bash
OPEN_AI_KEY=your-key go run cmd/gen/main.go -new
```

Note: This process may take a longer time as it will generate the provided seed data that will be inserted.

### Run Migrations

After migration file (`.sql`) created, next you need to run the migration. To run migrations, run:

```bash
go run cmd/migrate/main.go
```

### Congrats!

Congratulation! Your database initialization has finished ðŸš€

## SQLC

By using [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/), this app does not require you to write the models mapping of your table into Golang native structs yourself.

Moreover, you can write a raw SQL query in a `.sql` file and convert it into a Golang native `func` by placing the `.sql` file under the `scripts/queries` directory.

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ migrate
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ migrations
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 00_initial.up.sql
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ queries
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ order_items.sql (EXAMPLE)
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ orders.sql (EXAMPLE)
```

### Generate `struct` as models and `func` as queries

Since you already have your migration and query files, the next step is to generate the `struct` and `func` for it by running this command:

```bash
go run cmd/sqlc/main.go
```

This will generate `.go` files with an expected output like this:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ internal
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repo
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ psql
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ db.go
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ models.go
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ order_items.sql.go
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ orders.sql.go
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ querier.go
```

You can read the file as well by:

```bash
cat internal/repo/psql/models.go
```
